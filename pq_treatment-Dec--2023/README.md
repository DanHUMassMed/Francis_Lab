I have two subfolders in there, control N2 and PQ+_2 day_N2 and each has two replicates (noted as harvested 102223 and 110623). I am trying to compare transcriptomic difference between animals with PQ stress to the age matched control group for wildtype N2 animals.
Please let me know if you rather like control and PQ+ in one folder, for each harvest day.
Also, I made a list of differentially expressed genes with PQ stress in wildtype from previously published papers. They used different conditions than mine, but I am still interested whether any of these genes (especially sheet 3) appear in our analysis. I am attaching the list.
Regards.
